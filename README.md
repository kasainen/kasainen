# Kasainen — About Me

Hi, I’m Kasainen. I’m 17 and I like building simple, fast pages with clean UI and small, smooth animations.

## What I work on
- Web: landing pages and small dashboards, forms, basic animations, and tiny API routes.
- Tools: tiny scripts, Discord bots in Java, and CLI helpers (like file renamers).

## Before this
- I used to do 3D modeling.
- I made logos and server icons for game servers and small communities.
  - What I learned: clear shapes, readable type, calm colors.

## How I work
- Keep things tidy and easy to maintain.
- Ship small updates, read other people’s code, improve a bit at a time.

## Tech I use
- Web: HTML/CSS, Tailwind, React, Next.js
- Motion/Forms: Framer Motion, React Hook Form, Zod
- Bots: Java, JDA (Java Discord API)
